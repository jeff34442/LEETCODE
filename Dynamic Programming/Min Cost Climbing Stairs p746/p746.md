## Min Cost Climbing Stairs

### Problem: 
You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of the ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. 
You can either start from step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor. 

### Solution:
Similar to P70 (Climbing Stairs), we want to work backwards (top stair down to floor level) in order to get the minimum cost to traverse the stairs. 
In this problem, paying the cost per stair allows for the flexibility to go up one or two stairs. This allows us to do two things. 
1. We can extend the the cost array by one index. (i.e append one stair with value 0)
2. Iterate over the list backwards to get the minimum cost.
