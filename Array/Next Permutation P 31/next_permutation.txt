31. Next Permutation

A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].
The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.
Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: [1,2,3]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,5]
Output: [1,5,1]
 

Solution:
Find the first decreasing element from the right: Traverse the list from the right and find the first element nums[i] such that nums[i] < nums[i + 1]. If no such i exists, the entire array is in descending order, and we simply reverse the array to get the lowest possible order (ascending).

Find the element just larger than nums[i] to the right: After finding such an i, find the smallest element greater than nums[i] to its right, let's call this element nums[j].

Swap nums[i] and nums[j]: Swap these two elements to start forming the next permutation.

Reverse the subarray to the right of i: Finally, reverse the subarray starting from i + 1 to the end of the array to ensure it is in the lowest possible order, completing the next permutation.
